Changelog
=========

0.3 (unreleased)
----------------

- Add z3c.autoinclude.plugin magic invocation, removing the need to specify the
  package in buildout's zcml section.
  [smcmahon]

- Add automatic marking of IIsolatedObject and IObjectToIsolated objects for
  all Plone sites. Since a Plone site is never within a plone site, this is relatively
  safe. There is one exceptional case I can think of: subsites. Admins that wish to isolate
  subsites may wish to change this to protect the subsites rather than the plone site.
  [smcmahon]

- Add interface declarations for IIsolatedObject and IObjectToIsolate so that
  they appear in the "Interfaces" tab in the ZMI. This will allow admins to mark
  non-plone objects interactively.
